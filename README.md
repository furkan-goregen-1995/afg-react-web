# AFG-React-Laravel-Web-Appp

<p>I would like to present the "AFG React Laravel Web App" project, which is a basic website that I coded by collaborating with React and Larevel. After a long effort, I completed my project. I coded the admin panel of my project, which I run with existing frameworks and two different languages, with Laravel, and the site itself with React - Material UI.</p>
